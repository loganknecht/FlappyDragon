FlappyDragon
============

This is a adver-game that was created in order to help provide awareness for the movie How To Train Your Dragon 2 when it game out. The game is virtually the same as Flappy Bird except a timer is used to minimize actual gameplay time.

The client loved this so much they wanted to put it on their own website, but unfortunately we could not do that as AdColony was concerned about the overhead associated with managing and supporting the form they chose to implement it.

Drats.
